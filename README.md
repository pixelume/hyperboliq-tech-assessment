## Instructions

The SPA was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Download and unzip the archived file or clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/pixelume/hyperboliq-tech-assessment). After unzipping or cloning, run npm install to install the dependencies. I did deploy the finished SPA [here on Netlify](https://priceless-knuth-b0786b.netlify.app/) if you want to demo it.

## Notes and thoughts on the assignment

- What a well thought-out assignment. I enjoyed completing that

- Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

-   I also added a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pixelume/hyperboliq-tech-assessment) with the code

-   The finished SPA is deployed [here on Netlify](https://priceless-knuth-b0786b.netlify.app/).

-   This is the first time I got to work with react-bootstrap so I had read through their docs just a little bit

-   It is also the first time I was introduced to easy-peasy for state management. Fortunately, I have worked with Redux in a previous project so it was fairly quick and simple to pick up

-   I used the Styled Components CSS-in-JS library for some additional styling as that is what I’m most familiar with.

-   The styling is very bare-bones and I would have liked some more time to do a decent job of the styling as that is what I enjoy most. Because of the deadline however and in the absence of any design mockups, I prioritised functionality over design

-   I tried to structure the app and component tree in a logical, intuitive manner. There is a components folder with all the composite components, images where I keep some placeholder images, and styles folder with some global and a few shared styles that are used in multiple components.

-   I tried to make use of more modern loading skeleton animations that resemble the structure of the content that is loading. This gives a better user experience than generic loading animations. I didn’t quite have time to finish the loading skeleton for the card view, however.

-   The page is fully mobile responsive.

-   The _Search_ input is a controlled component with the state managed by React.
